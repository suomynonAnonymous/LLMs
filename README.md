# Quickstart Guide 
#### (from nothing)

- Set up github credentials (both ssh AND dev key)
- `git clone ` this (LLMs) repo
- Run `cd path/to/LLMs/`
- Run `python app.py`


#### (from already set up once before)
- run `cd path/to/LLMs/`

And that's pretty much it. Check the local urls to see where you can go.
